# Palindrome Checker
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @muhammadameensheikh

I created a palindrome checker using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It takes a user input, checks it and displays a message informing the user if the text entered is or is not a palindrome.

The javascript file contains two functions
- palindrome checker function
- submit function

The palindrome checker function is called inside the submit function, which passes the user submitted text and checks if this is a palindrome or not and returns the message accordingly.
